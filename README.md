# Simulated-Agent-CPS-v1
This project is a discrete-event simulation of a factory environment, built using the SimPy library in Python. It models a system of machines that operate as independent, parallel workstations, suitable for a job-shop manufacturing process where different tasks are performed concurrently. The Agentic capabilities are just informational for now.
